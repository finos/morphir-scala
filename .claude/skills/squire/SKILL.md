# Squire — morphir-scala Dev Environment Assistant

Squire diagnoses and unblocks development environment issues, manages reference repositories and branch lifecycle, and owns task-tracking configuration for the morphir-scala project.

## Commands

### `/squire ai env info`

Reports whether the current session is actually sandboxed (JVM/Python network sockets, effective JVM-temp writes) as structured JSON — live-probed, not guessed from `CLAUDE_CODE_*` env vars. Other skills and build scripts (mill task wrappers, etc.) can consume this instead of assuming "running under Claude Code" implies restricted.

Read the full reference before running:
→ [references/env.md](references/env.md)

**When to invoke:** Before deciding whether to use a daemon/server process, a JVM network call, or a JVM-temp-writing tool — or any time you'd otherwise guess sandbox status from environment variables alone.

### `/squire doctor`

Runs a full environment diagnostic and reports actionable fixes for known blockers.

Read the full diagnostic procedure and issue catalogue before running:
→ [references/doctor.md](references/doctor.md)

**When to invoke:** Any time a Bash tool call fails with a build, network, or sandbox error — especially before retrying the failed command.

### `/squire mill morphir`

Explains the fast source-module route, the published-plugin dogfood route, and focused recovery commands.

Read the full reference before running:
→ [references/mill-morphir.md](references/mill-morphir.md)

**When to invoke:** When developing a Mill Morphir plugin, generating Morphir IR, testing a fresh published-plugin consumer, or diagnosing plugin/cache/metabuild state.

### `/squire reference repo`

Manages reference repositories under `.refs/`. Clone external repos, symlink existing local repos, or create git worktrees for ref-based snapshots. A manifest at `.refs/manifest.json` tracks all entries.

Read the full reference before running:
→ [references/repo.md](references/repo.md)

**When to invoke:** When asked to add a reference repo, clone an upstream project, list or check existing references, or when context about an external codebase is needed locally.

Sub-commands: `squire reference repo add`, `squire reference repo list`, `squire reference repo status`, `squire reference repo remove`

### `/squire branch refresh`

Safely refreshes a remote target branch from `origin/main` after its target-to-main pull request has been squash-merged. The target defaults to `develop`; use `--dry-run` to prove the refresh without pushing.

Read the full reference completely before running:
→ [references/branch.md](references/branch.md)

**When to invoke:** After squash-merging an integration branch into `main`, when the remote target should begin its next lifecycle at the new `main` tip.

### `/squire tracking`

Owns task-tracking configuration: resolves whether [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`) applies to this checkout, supports opting out per contributor, and keeps `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointing at one canonical guidance document rather than accumulating tool-generated blocks.

Beads is **optional** here — nothing in the build, the test suites, or CI reads `.beads/`. Never assume it is in use; resolve the mode first.

Read the full reference before running:
→ [references/tracking.md](references/tracking.md)

**When to invoke:** Before creating or updating a task/issue, at the start of any session where work will be tracked, when asked to opt out of (or back into) beads, and when a `bd init`/`bd setup` run has re-added its own guidance block to the agent instruction files.

Sub-commands: `squire tracking status`, `squire tracking sync`, `squire tracking doctor`

Contributor-facing guidance, conventions and opt-out steps live in [docs/task-tracking.md](../../../docs/task-tracking.md).

### `/squire spec sync` and `/squire spec export`

Round-trips the Morphir IR specification, design documents and JSON schemas between `finos/morphir` and the knowledge base bundle that mirrors them. `spec sync` imports upstream's changes; `spec export` projects local edits back into a reference checkout, runs upstream's own validators, and stops short of committing.

The `kb` skill owns the mechanism (`kb sync status|pull|push|diff`); squire owns the Morphir specifics — the repo, the ref, the sparse subtrees, the validators, and the order things run in.

Read the full reference before running:
→ [references/spec-sync.md](references/spec-sync.md)

**When to invoke:** When asked to sync, import or export the Morphir spec or schemas, to refresh the mirrored upstream bundle, or to prepare spec changes for a pull request against `finos/morphir`. Also run `spec sync` before starting spec work, so the bundle reflects today's upstream.

Sub-commands: `squire spec sync`, `squire spec export`

### `/squire schemas`

Generates the Morphir IR JSON schemas from the YAML the knowledge base mirrors, and checks that the two are in step.

```bash
mise run schemas:build     # YAML → JSON, into .dev/out/squire/schemas/
mise run schemas:check     # metaschema conformance, then validate every mirrored v4 document
bun .claude/skills/squire/scripts/schemas-to-json.ts --from <dir> --check
```

The knowledge base mirrors the YAML only. Upstream generates the `.json` siblings with
`website/scripts/yaml-to-json-schemas.js`, which runs during its Netlify build and nowhere else — so nothing verifies
the committed JSON still matches the YAML, and the generator cannot run in a checkout without `npm install`. This
reproduces that generator exactly, using bun's native YAML parsing, with no dependencies; `--check` is the
verification upstream lacks, and `spec export` runs it.

Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not reformat: byte-identical output is what stops the next Netlify
deploy rewriting whatever we send, and none of upstream's committed JSON is canonical by `jsonschema fmt` anyway. And
it does not fail on documents that were already failing — at the pinned commit every complete v4 document upstream
publishes is rejected by upstream's own v4 schema. That is recorded as a finding in the `morphir-ir-v4-draft` bundle,
not treated as a gate.

**When to invoke:** When a mirrored schema has been edited, before an export, or when asked whether the IR documents
and the IR schemas actually agree.
