# SDK
These are the basic building blocks for building your domain model and business logic. It also serves as a specification for backend developers that describes the minimum set of functionality each backend implementation should support.

These are scala implementations of the `Morphir.SDK` found in [morphir-elm](https://github.com/finos/morphir-elm/tree/main/src/Morphir/SDK).


You can find the current support page here: [Morphir Scala Support](https://morphir.finos.org/docs/scala/morphir-scala-support).
